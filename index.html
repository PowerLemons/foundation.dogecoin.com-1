<h1>The times they are a changing...</h1>

<p>Over the past few months, we've achieved some great things. From sending the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics through to pairing service dogs or providing clean water to kids in need. As The Foundation has grown from a rag-tag group of loosely organized, volunteer community members, it's quickly become clear that it needs to pull together in a more official manner. That's why we'd like to announce that we are beginning the transition process to a democratically elected board and that the term of the initial Foundation board members is coming to a close. The seats are empty, and ready to be filled by the best and brightest from our amazing community!</p>

<p>As announced recently at DOGECON SF, on May 5th 2014 there will be a thread opened for submissions on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin">reddit.com/r/dogecoin</a> by trusted community leaders (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/mohland">/u/mohland</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/mumzie">/u/mumzie</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/goodshibe">/u/goodshibe</a>), to help nominate and decide the future leaders of The Dogecoin Foundation. Rules for nomination and voting criteria will be defined by the community leaders listed above prior to May 5th, as to ensure the process is entirely objective and democratic.</p>

<p>In lieu of a Foundation board, the 1,620,322 DOGE held in the "General Fund" wallet has been transferred to Josh Mohland (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/mohland">/u/mohland</a>), creator of Dogetipbot, who is a well known and trusted community leader; he will work with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/mumzie">/u/mumzie</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/goodshibe">/u/goodshibe</a> to ensure the funds make their way to the next generation of The Foundation. The management of this website will be handed over to community leaders listed above and the official web design maintainer of dogecoin.com also. We're really looking forward to seeing what "v2" of The Foundation looks like, and the refreshed vision our new leaders develop.</p>

<p>It's been an exciting time for Dogecoin, and it's only going to get more exciting as we venture to the moon! Stay tuned for more details on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin">reddit.com/r/dogecoin</a></p>
